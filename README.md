## convert-APway_CURRENT.py
This is the original converter, which is creating hyperlinks for IE 11 favorites based on P2way.xml. It currently requires ElementTree and pywin32.
Note: It creates .lnk files, rather than .url files. Realizing this issue made me pick up this old problem again. I will soon fix this!
